## A Report About "Superstar Effect", A Chart About Nothing...

Here is a chart from the [*report*](http://musically.com/2014/03/04/how-digital-music-services-may-be-fuelling-a-superstar-artist-economy/?curator=MediaREDEF) called "How digital music services may be fuelling a ‘superstar artist economy’", by Stuart Dredge.

![](http://musically.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/superstar-music.jpg)

### I. Basic Construction Issues
Let alone how poorly is the chart related to the information it's trying to show, it is junky because of these following construction issues:

* Confusing vertical axis

The vertical axis on the left is repeated, which should be halved instead, therefore makes it hard to read. "$0, $0.5, $1, $1.5, $2, $2.5,..." is the correct version of the vertical axis.

* Data lables are redundant but pointless

With the vertical axis fixed, readers can easily read the number each bar represents, so that the labels on the bars seem to be excessive. The chart will look more neat without them as well.

### II. Message Misalignment

However, the biggest problem of this chart is not telling the story. If you read the article, you'll doubt the that the chart and the article aren't about the same thing at all.

#### *What do we get from the chart?*

* A decreasing trend.

Since the chart is organized in annual order, a very straightforward message is that the total income in music industry and the proportion made by the remainder artists are decreasing from 2000 to 2013. If we read it more carefully, we can see a drop in the amount made by superstar artists as well.

* Proportion for the most recent year.

The stacked column bar does give us an idea about how superstar income and remainder income compared against each other during the years, however, the exact proportiona are hard to read from the absolute amounts except for the most recent year 2013.

#### *What's the idea of the article?*

* Superstar Aritist Economy

One of the key findings of this article is that while artists’ share of total recorded-music income has grown from 14% in 2000 to 17% in 2013, the top 1% of musical works are now accounting for 77% of all those artist revenues thanks in part to a “tyranny of choice” on digital services. One background knowledge is that digital music services were expected to balance the share of income between superstars and the remainder artists as a result of "long tail effect", but it ended up fuelling a "superstar aritist economy" because only a small portion (1%) of the digital catelogue was streamed or purchased seriously. 

From the context, it would be nicer to deliver the message in the chart that the top 1% (superstar) artists continue to earn about 75 percent of total income and this distribution has not changed noticeably despite the Long Tail phenonmenon. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to emphasize the proportions instead of the absolute amounts in the *stacked column chart^{1}*. I would be more interested in how the proportions changed over time, thus I will consider using a *100% stacked column chart^{2}* to show the evolvement in proportions and use a line chart layered on top to show the trends in absolute amounts. 

Note 1: *Stacked column charts* show the relationship of individual items to the whole, comparing the contribution of each value to a total across categories. 

Note 2: Maybe should use *100% stacked column chart* compares the percentage that each value contributes to a total across categories.


### III. How to improve

The chart needs to be fixed so that it doesn't have any basic construction issues and more is consistent with the report context.

Here is a table with information got directly from the chart and calculations I made accordingly.

#### R code
I used the following code in R to get my improved version of the chart.

*Get Set Up*

```{r}
# load in libraries used in script
library(reshape)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales) 

# set working directory and read in data.
setwd("~/Documents/QMSS/2015spring/DataViz/blogpost_badchart/")
data <- read.csv("data.csv",header=TRUE)

# reshape the data for plotting
df1 <- data[,c("year","superstar_proportion","remainder_proportion")]
DF1 <- melt(df1, id.var="year")

df2 <- data[,c("year","superstar","remainder","total")]
DF2 <- melt(df2, id.var="year")
```

*Charts*

I will be using a stacked bar plot and a time series line plot, and then combine them together on one chart by adding layers using ggplot, here is the code for getting the plot separately. 

* Change colors to make prettier.

* Use "group" to plot multiple time series lines at one time.

```{r}
# The two plots
bar <- ggplot (DF1, aes(x = as.character(year), y = value ,fill = variable )) + 
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      labs (x = 'year', y = 'Income Proportions(100%)' ) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("blue", "red"), .3)) +
      theme_bw()

line <- ggplot (DF2, aes(x = as.character(year), y=value, group=variable,colour = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs (x = 'year', y = 'Income (million $)') +
  scale_fill_hue() 
```
Here is the two charts from the program output:

*Combined Chart*

The combined version looks like this and was got from these few lines of code.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuTian9/edav/gh-pages/_posts/yt_pngs/mychart.png)

```{r}
ggplot (data=DF1, mapping=aes(x = as.character(year))) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", mapping=aes(y = value*4 ,fill = variable )) +
  geom_text(aes(y=abs(4-value*4)+0.5, ymax=value, label=paste(round(value*100, 2), "%", sep = ""))) +  
  geom_line (data=DF2, aes(y=value, group=variable,colour = variable)) +
  labs (title = 'Music Income & Share', x = 'year', y = 'Income (million $)') +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(),axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("blue", "red"), .3)) 
```

### IV. Dual Axis Chart in R

If you're layering two charts with very different scale, you might want to have two vertical axes with one on the left side and the other on the right. Here are some good sources I found online that may be helpful.

#### *Dual axis using "plot"*

```{r}
## set up test data
time <- seq(0,72,12)
betagal.abs <- c(0.05,0.18,0.25,0.31,0.32,0.34,0.35)
cell.density <- c(0,1000,2000,3000,4000,5000,6000)

## add extra space to right margin of plot within frame
par(mar=c(5, 4, 4, 6) + 0.1)

## Plot first set of data and draw its axis
plot(time, betagal.abs, pch=16, axes=FALSE, ylim=c(0,1), xlab="", ylab="", 
   type="b",col="black", main="Mike's test data")
axis(2, ylim=c(0,1),col="black",las=1)  ## las=1 makes horizontal labels
mtext("Beta Gal Absorbance",side=2,line=2.5)
box()

## Allow a second plot on the same graph
par(new=TRUE)

## Plot the second plot and put axis scale on right
plot(time, cell.density, pch=15,  xlab="", ylab="", ylim=c(0,7000), 
    axes=FALSE, type="b", col="red")
## a little farther out (line=4) to make room for labels
mtext("Cell Density",side=4,col="red",line=4) 
axis(4, ylim=c(0,7000), col="red",col.axis="red",las=1)

## Draw the time axis
axis(1,pretty(range(time),10))
mtext("Time (Hours)",side=1,col="black",line=2.5)  

## Add Legend
legend("topleft",legend=c("Beta Gal","Cell Density"),
  text.col=c("black","red"),pch=c(16,15),col=c("black","red"))
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuTian9/edav/gh-pages/_posts/yt_pngs/example1.png)

#### *Dual axis in ggplot*

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gtable)
library(grid)

# two plots
p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp)) + geom_line(colour = "blue") + theme_bw()
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, drat)) + geom_line(colour = "red") + theme_bw() %+replace% 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA))

# extract gtable
g1 <- ggplot_gtable(ggplot_build(p1))
g2 <- ggplot_gtable(ggplot_build(p2))

# overlap the panel of 2nd plot on that of 1st plot
pp <- c(subset(g1$layout, name == "panel", se = t:r))
g <- gtable_add_grob(g1, g2$grobs[[which(g2$layout$name == "panel")]], pp$t, 
                     pp$l, pp$b, pp$l)

# axis tweaks
ia <- which(g2$layout$name == "axis-l")
ga <- g2$grobs[[ia]]
ax <- ga$children[[2]]
ax$widths <- rev(ax$widths)
ax$grobs <- rev(ax$grobs)
ax$grobs[[1]]$x <- ax$grobs[[1]]$x - unit(1, "npc") + unit(0.15, "cm")
g <- gtable_add_cols(g, g2$widths[g2$layout[ia, ]$l], length(g$widths) - 1)
g <- gtable_add_grob(g, ax, pp$t, length(g$widths) - 1, pp$b)

# draw it
grid.newpage()
grid.draw(g)
```
